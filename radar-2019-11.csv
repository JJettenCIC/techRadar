It combines a powerful and flexible pipeline management system with integrations to the major cloud providers.
Razee;Asses;tools;FALSE;Razee is an open-source project that was developed by IBM to automate and manage the deployment of Kubernetes resources across clusters, environments, and cloud providers, and to visualize deployment information for your resources so that you can monitor the rollout process and find deployment issues more quickly.
Kubebox;Asses;tools;FALSE;Terminal and Web console for Kubernetes that allows visualization for your kubernetes resources and their behaviour
Octant;Asses;tools;FALSE;Octant is a tool for developers to understand how applications run on a Kubernetes cluster. It aims to be part of the developer's toolkit for gaining insight and approaching complexity found in Kubernetes. Octant offers a combination of introspective tooling, cluster navigation, and object management along with a plugin system to further extend its capabilities.
kubespy;Asses;tools;FALSE;kubespy is a small tool that makes it easy to observe how Kubernetes resources change in real time, derived from the work we did to make Kubernetes deployments predictable in Pulumi's CLI. Run kubespy at any point in time, and it will watch and report information about a Kubernetes resource continuously until you kill it.
Concourse;Adopt;tools;FALSE;A tool for supporting the continuous integration method. Can run predefined processes or shell scripts to have an automatically triggered pipeline for branches and pullrequests.
Bitbucket;Adopt;tools;FALSE;Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial (since launch till June 1, 2020) or Git (since October 2011) revision control systems. Bitbucket offers both commercial plans and free accounts. It offers free accounts with an unlimited number of private repositories (which can have up to five users in the case of free accounts) as of September 2010. Bitbucket integrates with other Atlassian software like Jira, HipChat, Confluence and Bamboo. It is similar to GitHub, which primarily uses Git. Bitbucket has traditionally marketed its services to professional developers with private proprietary software code, especially since being acquired by Atlassian in 2010. In February 2017, Bitbucket announced it had reached 6 million developers and 1 million teams on its platform. In April 2019 Atlassian announced that Bitbucket reached 10 million registered users and over 28 million repositories.
SonarQube;Adopt;tools;FALSE;SonarQube is an automatic code review tool to detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in your code. It is often integrated in the pullrequest continuous integration to ensure a level of code quality.
Urban Code Deploy;Hold;tools;FALSE;IBM UrbanCode Deploy is a tool for automating application deployments through your environments. It is designed to facilitate rapid feedback and continuous delivery in agile development while providing the audit trails, versioning and approvals needed in production.

LogDNA;Adopt;tools;TRUE;
IBM Cloud;Adopt;platforms;FALSE;IBM Cloud is a suite of cloud computing services from IBM that offers both platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). With IBM Cloud IaaS, organizations can deploy and access virtualized IT resources -- such as compute power, storage and networking -- over the internet.
Cloud Foundry;Adopt;platforms;FALSE;Cloud Foundry is an open source cloud platform as a service (PaaS) on which developers can build, deploy, run and scale applications. VMware originally created Cloud Foundry, and it is now part of Pivotal Software, whose parent company is Dell Technologies. Cloud Foundry is licensed under Apache 2.0 and supports Java, Node.js, Go, PHP, Python, Ruby, .NET Core and Staticfile. The open source PaaS is highly customizable, allowing developers to code in multiple languages and frameworks. This eliminates the potential for vendor lock-in, which is a common concern with PaaS.
Kubernetes;Adopt;platforms;FALSE;Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
AWS;Asses;platforms;FALSE;Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.
Azure;Asses;platforms;FALSE;Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.
Google Cloud;Asses;platforms;FALSE;Google Cloud Platform, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and YouTube.
Openshift;Trial;platforms;FALSE;Red Hat® OpenShift® is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform with full-stack automated operations to manage hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments. Red Hat OpenShift is optimized to improve developer productivity and promote innovation.
Open Whisk(Functions as a Service);Trial;platforms;FALSE;Apache OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless platform that executes functions (fx) in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk manages the infrastructure, servers and scaling using Docker containers so you can focus on building amazing and efficient applications. The OpenWhisk platform supports a programming model in which developers write functional logic (called Actions), in any supported programming language, that can be dynamically scheduled and run in response to associated events (via Triggers) from external sources (Feeds) or from HTTP requests. The project includes a REST API-based Command Line Interface (CLI) along with other tooling to support packaging, catalog services and many popular container deployment options.
PR deployments;Trial;techniques;FALSE;In an effort to move left and catch issues in the code base as early as possible a test deployment can be triggered from the creation of a pullrequests. This ensures any changes made are compatible with the code base and that they result in a running service.
BFF(Backend For Frontend);Trial;techniques;FALSE;A Backend for Frontend (BFF) architecture can be used to create backends for client-facing mobile or web apps. BFF’s can help support an application with multiple clients while at the same time moving the system into a less-coupled state than a monolith system. This code pattern helps teams iterate features faster and have control over the backends for mobile apps without affecting the experience for a corresponding mobile or web app.
Continouos deployments;Trial;techniques;FALSE;Continuous deployment is a strategy for software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the software's users. Continuous deployment eliminates the human safeguards against unproven code in live software. It should only be implemented when the development and IT teams rigorously adhere to production-ready development practices and thorough testing, and when they apply sophisticated, real-time monitoring in production to discover any issues with new releases.
Continuous Integration;Adopt;techniques;FALSE;With continuous integration the build and automated tests are moved as close to the development process as possible. Immutable packages are build to ensure reproducible deployments, and unit tests and compilation steps are performed.
Agile;Adopt;techniques;FALSE;"Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a ""big bang"" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments."
devops;Adopt;techniques;FALSE;DevOps is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. The concept of DevOps is founded on building a culture of collaboration between the development and operations teams that historically functioned in relative siloes.
Manual deployments;Hold;techniques;FALSE;Although appropriate when doing a one-off deployment, the main goal should be for running projects to deploy reliably and frequently. To this end the deployment process should be automated as much as is reasonable.
Seperation between ops and dev;Hold;techniques;FALSE;Traditional IT promoted the idea of a strict separation between operations teams and development teams. This enforces a better separation between test and production environments and limits the amount of people who have access to the production environments.
Bare-metal deployments;Hold;techniques;FALSE;Provisioning bare-metal machines requires a diverse skillset of hardware knowledge, system administration plus domain knowledge about the technology you want to deploy on top of the bare-metal infrastructure. The biggest benefits to bare-metal cloud infrastructure is the increased performance and data isolation. However the tradeoff is an increase in time to set up and expertise needed. Few projects have such specific requirements that make this tradeoff worthwhile.
Preview environments;Asses;techniques;FALSE;Preview environments are build and deployed to when a pullrequest is created. This goes beyond just checking if the deployment process works, and gives reviewers a quick way to see changes to code in action. Although this is mostly relevant for projects that work with frontend as css changes are harder to judge based on the code alone, it could be used in any project given the right testing tools and practices.
Infrastructure as code;Asses;techniques;FALSE;Infrastructure as code is the practice of defining infrastructure through datafiles, often json or yaml, and then using tools like terraform to translate these files to running infrastructure. This gives a few advantages, first it allows you to recreate the infrastructure in the case of catastrophic failure. Second it allows you to have a structured review process for changes to the infrastructure.
